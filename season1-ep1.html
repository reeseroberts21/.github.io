            <p class="box-text">
                Okay, so this is where it all kicks off—<em>Severance</em> starts with Mark Scout waking up on a table at Lumon Industries, totally confused, and Helly’s there asking him stuff like it’s some weird job interview from hell. He’s an innie, split from his outie life, and outside, the real Mark’s just a dude grieving his wife, Gemma, while his neighbor Mrs. Selvig (who’s secretly Ms. Cobel, mind blown) keeps tabs on him. Inside, Mark’s team—Dylan, Irving, and newbie Helly—start refining these crazy numbers, and it’s all super mysterious and creepy. That’s the gist—bam, we’re in!

            <h2 class="box-head">My Rating</h2>
            <p class="box-text">
                I’m giving this a solid 9 out of 10—it’s a killer start, hooks you right in without overexplaining, and sets up so much juicy stuff to chew on. It’s like Panic! at the Disco’s “I Write Sins Not Tragedies”—tight, catchy, and leaves you wanting more, a total banger that nails the vibe from the jump.

            <h2 class="box-head">Theories Out the Wazoo</h2>
            <ul class="theory-list">
                <li class="theory-item">
                    Alright, so first off, what’s up with this severance thing—could it be more than just splitting memories? Like, what if they’re actually cloning people or something nuts like that? Mark wakes up all dazed on that table, and Helly’s grilling him like she’s testing something—what if it’s not his first time there, you know? Maybe they’ve got a bunch of Mark copies running around, and this is just the latest one waking up, totally clueless. I mean, the way he’s so foggy about everything, it’s like his brain’s been wiped and rebooted, not just split, and that’s freaky as hell to think about—like, are we even watching the real Mark here?
                </li>
                <li class="theory-item">
                    And then there’s Helly—man, she’s got this vibe like she’s not buying any of this Lumon crap from the second she opens her eyes. What if her outie’s some kind of rebel or something, and her innie’s picking up on that somehow? Like, maybe the severance isn’t perfect, and bits of her real self are leaking through—I saw how she hesitated answering those questions, almost like she’s fighting it inside. Could be the tech’s got cracks, and she’s the first one showing it, which would totally mess with Lumon’s whole deal, right? Like, imagine if she’s secretly aware of more than she lets on, just playing along for now.
                </li>
                <li class="theory-item">
                    Oh, and those numbers they’re refining—what even are they? I’ve been thinking about this nonstop, and I’m betting they’re not just random data. What if they’re, like, pieces of people’s memories or something? Like, they’re sitting there sorting through stuff that used to be in someone’s head—maybe even their own heads—and they don’t even know it! It’s all so hush-hush, and the way they’re so focused on it, it’s gotta be important, right? Could be Lumon’s collecting something big, like building a giant memory bank or a mind control thing—okay, that’s wild, but this episode’s got me paranoid already!
                </li>
                <li class="theory-item">
                    Then there’s Ms. Cobel pretending to be Mrs. Selvig—holy crap, that’s sneaky. Why’s she watching Mark outside like that? I think she’s gotta be some kind of spy or enforcer for Lumon, making sure his outie doesn’t figure anything out. Like, what if she’s there to keep him sad and distracted about Gemma so his innie stays in line? Or maybe she’s testing if the severance holds up outside the building—like, she’s poking around to see if he remembers anything he shouldn’t. That double life she’s pulling off is shady as hell, and I’m convinced she’s up to way more than just being nosy.
                </li>
                <li class="theory-item">
                    Speaking of Gemma, alright, this one’s a stretch, but what if she’s not really dead? Like, what if Lumon faked her death and she’s still alive somewhere, maybe even inside Lumon as an innie herself? Mark’s so torn up about her, but we don’t see a body or anything—it’s all just him moping around. Could be they severed her too, and she’s working in some other department, and he doesn’t even know she’s right under his nose! That’d be a gut punch, and this episode’s got that sneaky vibe where anything’s possible, you know?
                </li>
                <li class="theory-item">
                    Oh, and the whole Lumon setup—those sterile halls and weird rules—it’s giving me cult vibes big time. What if this isn’t just a company but some freaky secret society? Like, the severance thing could be their way of brainwashing people into loyal drones, and Mark and the team are just the first batch. The way they’re so calm about not knowing anything outside, it’s like they’ve been programmed to not even care—maybe that’s the real point of all this, turning people into perfect little workers who don’t ask questions!
                </li>
                <li class="theory-item">
                    Last one for now—those wellness sessions they hint at, what’s that about? I’m thinking they’re not just some HR fluff—what if they’re, like, hypnosis or something to keep the innies in check? Mark’s all chill about it, but Helly’s not, and that makes me wonder if it’s messing with their heads more than we see. Could be Lumon’s got this whole mind control layer going on, and the first episode’s just scratching the surface of how deep it goes—man, I’m already losing sleep over this!
