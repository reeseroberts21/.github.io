                Episode 6’s intense—Mark Scout’s innie and outie collide at “Attila,” a secret Lumon facility, where they face a brutal reintegration test. Helly R. leads MDR in a defiant push, while Reghabi’s motives get darker. Outside, Devon and Ricken uncover more of Petey’s files, and Helena Eagan’s control tightens with a chilling reveal.

                10 out of 10—brutal, epic, pure <em>Severance</em> fire! It’s like Fall Out Boy’s “My Songs Know What You Did in the Dark”—dark, explosive, and leaves you reeling.

                    Attila facility—holy crap, what’s this place? I’m thinking it’s Lumon’s ultimate lab—where they test severance to the breaking point! Like, Mark Scout’s innie-outie clash there could be a final experiment—could be why it’s so brutal, they’re pushing him to snap or reintegrate completely! Maybe it’s where they built the chips, and that green MDR glow’s strongest here—control central!
                </li>
                <li class="theory-item">
                    Mark’s clash—man, he’s breaking bad! What if Attila’s the endgame for reintegration? Like, Reghabi’s pushing him to merge, but it’s killing him—could be why Petey crashed, it’s a do-or-die test! Maybe Lumon’s watching to see if severance can hold or if they need a new tech—Mark’s the guinea pig who’s gonna show them!
                </li>
                <li class="theory-item">
                    Helly R.’s defiance—dude, she’s unstoppable! What if she’s cracked Attila’s secrets? Like, she’s leading MDR to fight back—could be she found files or tech there, and she’s about to blow this wide open! That green glow might be her key—maybe it’s powering her innie now, keeping her rebellion strong!
                </li>
                <li class="theory-item">
                    Reghabi’s darker—still don’t trust her! What if she runs Attila? Like, Lumon’s using her to test reintegration limits—could be Mark’s the bait, and she’s watching him die or survive! Maybe she’s got a new chip or wipe tech—Petey’s crash was just practice, and Mark’s next in line!
                </li>
                <li class="theory-item">
                    Petey’s files—Devon and Ricken finding more—huge! What if they’ve got Attila’s blueprint? Like, Petey left proof of this place—could be why Mark’s outie’s freaking out, it’s waking him up! Maybe those files lead to Helena Eagan or the chips—total rebellion fuel!
                </li>
                <li class="theory-item">
                    Helena Eagan’s reveal—chilling as hell! What if she’s severed at Attila? Like, her innie’s been there forever—could be why that green glow’s so strong, it’s her control hub! Maybe she’s testing Mark and Helly to see if severance holds—or if it’s time to upgrade with Attila’s tech!
                </li>
                <li class="theory-item">
                    The numbers—are they dead? What if Attila killed MDR refining? Like, they’re at this facility because severance’s failing—could be that green glow’s gone, and Lumon’s testing a new system! Maybe Attila’s the new MDR, and they’re rebuilding from scratch there!
                </li>
                <li class="theory-item">
                    Oh, and since you mentioned Episode 6, let’s tie in Burt and Reghabi inventing the severance chip—Fields saying he was out with his “Lumon Partner” is massive! I’m all in on Reghabi being that partner—she’s old enough, and even with Dr. Mauer popping up, she’s the biggest suspect. Maybe Burt did the procedure himself, like Helly R., to prove it was safe—experimental, not religious bullshit like they claimed. That story about going to heaven while ignoring the gay thing? Total cover-up, man—I think Burt’s been running this show quietly the whole time, staying severed to support his creation, especially after Reghabi bailed on Lumon. His retirement? Probably just him stepping back after perfecting it—O&D’s his legacy, and he’s been pulling strings all along at Attila!
