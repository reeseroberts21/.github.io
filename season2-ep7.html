                Episode 7, “Chikhai Bardo,” dives deep—Helly explores Lumon’s file rooms, facing traumatic simulations like planes and dentists, while Mark’s outie struggles with reintegration at Cold Harbor. Helly’s defiance grows, Reghabi’s motives darken, and Helena Eagan reveals more control, hinting at Lumon’s global plans.

                10 out of 10—this is the best episode of TV of all time, hands down, right up there with *BoJack Horseman*’s “The View from Halfway Down” and *Breaking Bad*’s “Ozymandias.” It’s mind-blowing, gut-wrenching, and sets a new bar for <em>Severance</em>—like Fall Out Boy’s “Thnks fr th Mmrs” on steroids, an emotional nuke that’ll stick with you forever.

                    Alright, dude, <em>Severance</em> Episode 7, “Chikhai Bardo,” just dropped a ton of stuff to unpack—Helly going into all those file rooms and facing those wild traumas, like planes and dentists, it’s got me thinking Lumon’s onto something huge with this severance chip. I’m totally on board with your idea that they’re gonna market it as a way to have multiple innies for stuff people hate—think about it, who wouldn’t want to dissociate during a root canal or a flight with screaming kids? Like, Lumon’s probably planning to roll this out worldwide, eventually severing everyone so they’ve got innies for every annoying task—cooking, cleaning, taxes, you name it! Could be why they’re testing it so hard on Mark, Helly, and the crew—perfecting it to take over the globe, turning us all into Lumon drones with a side of green MDR glow, man!
                </li>
                <li class="theory-item">
                    And that drown-or-suffocate question—holy crap, that’s gotta be foreshadowing Gemma’s fate, right? I’m with you on her dying at Cold Harbor, facing the ultimate fear: death itself. Like, it’s coming, and it’s gonna hit hard—maybe she’s in some deep test down there, and that question’s a dark hint she’s not making it out. Sad as hell, but it fits <em>Severance</em>’s vibe—Lumon’s cold enough to let that happen, especially if they see her as expendable after her severance role. What if Cold Harbor’s where they dump failed innies, and Gemma’s next on the chopping block? Maybe they’re prepping her for some final wipe, and that green glow’s fading out as she goes—total tragedy!
                </li>
                <li class="theory-item">
                    The Orpheus and Eurydice thing—man, that’s deep! Mark’s totally Orpheus, chasing Gemma (Eurydice) into the “underworld” of Lumon’s testing floors. Hymen’s line about the marriage not lasting? That’s Lumon deciding Mark and Gemma aren’t meant to be together—severing her “death” and sticking her in there as Ms. Casey, or now deeper in Cold Harbor, was their way of screwing fate. I’m betting Mark’s gonna dive into that hellhole to save her, but I’m torn—will he “look back” like Orpheus and doom her, or is his reintegration the twist that either saves or kills her? Maybe reintegration’s the look-back moment, merging him and losing her forever—super tragic, like a Panic! at the Disco breakdown! What if Cold Harbor’s the final act, and Mark’s choice there seals her fate, with that green glow flickering out as she goes?
                </li>
                <li class="theory-item">
                    Oh, and let’s loop in that Episode 6 theory about Burt and Reghabi inventing the severance chip—Fields saying he was out with his “Lumon Partner” is massive! I’m all in on Reghabi being that partner—she’s old enough, and even with Dr. Mauer popping up, she’s the biggest suspect. Maybe Burt did the procedure himself, like Helly, to prove it was safe—experimental, not religious bullshit like they claimed. That story about going to heaven while ignoring the gay thing? Total cover-up, man—I think Burt’s been running this show quietly the whole time, staying severed to support his creation, especially after Reghabi bailed on Lumon. His retirement? Probably just him stepping back after perfecting it—O&D’s his legacy, and he’s been pulling strings all along at Attila and now Cold Harbor!
                </li>
                <li class="theory-item">
                    Cold Harbor itself—man, it’s creepy as hell! What if it’s not just a test but Lumon’s execution ground? Like, Helly’s traumas there—drowning, suffocation—are rehearsals for what they do to failed innies, and Gemma’s next. Could be they’re using it to wipe or kill innies who break, and that drown-or-suffocate question’s their playbook—maybe they’re prepping Gemma for a final “experiment” where she doesn’t come back, and that green MDR glow’s her lifeline fading out!
                </li>
                <li class="theory-item">
                    Helly’s defiance—dude, she’s on fire! What if she’s cracked Cold Harbor’s secrets? Like, those file rooms might hold data on everyone severed—Gemma, Mark, even Burt. Could be she’s finding proof of Lumon’s global plan, and that green glow’s her weapon now, powering her innie to fight back! Maybe she’s close to shutting down severance for good, but it’ll cost her—Lumon’s not letting go without a fight!
                </li>
                <li class="theory-item">
                    Reghabi’s deeper—still don’t trust her! What if she’s running Cold Harbor? Like, Lumon’s using her to test the ultimate reintegration—or wipe. Could be she’s pushing Mark to merge or die there, and Helly’s push is screwing her plan! Maybe she’s got a new chip from Attila, and Cold Harbor’s where they finish the job—Petey’s crash was just the warm-up!
                </li>
                <li class="theory-item">
                    Helena Eagan—her grip’s tighter than ever! What if she’s severed at Cold Harbor? Like, her innie’s been there forever, controlling everything—could be why that green glow’s so strong, it’s her power source! Maybe she’s testing Mark and Gemma to see if severance holds, or if it’s time to roll out the global plan—Chikhai Bardo’s her final test!
                </li>
                <li class="theory-item">
                    The numbers—are they gone for good? What if Cold Harbor means MDR’s done refining? Like, they’re focused on this facility because severance’s failing—could be that green glow’s dead, and Lumon’s shifting to a new system! Maybe Cold Harbor’s the new MDR, and they’re using Helly’s traumas to build it!
                </li>
                <li class="theory-item">
                    O&D’s quiet—where’s Burt? What if he’s at Cold Harbor, pulling strings? Like, those weapons mean he’s prepping—could be waiting for Helly to lead a charge there! Maybe he’s got a plan with Irving to take down Lumon, using his chip invention against them—Chikhai Bardo could be the showdown!
